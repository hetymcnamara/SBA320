Welcome to my React web app project! Given the crazy weather here in NY, I decided to build a weather app that gives users current weather conditions in their locationof choice.

THe below  requirements have been met: 

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT, and Redux Toolkit.
Hosted on Heroku or Netlify.
Frequent commits to GitHub.
A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:

Explanations of the technologies used.
Explanations of the approach taken.
A link to your live site.
Usage instructions, if relevant.
Unsolved problems.
etc.
Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi, and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM.
